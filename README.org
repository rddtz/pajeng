* PajeNG

PajeNG (Paje Next Generation) is a re-implementation in C++ of the
well-known [[http://paje.sf.net][Paje visualization tool]] for the analysis of execution
traces (in the [[http://paje.sourceforge.net/download/publication/lang-paje.pdf][Paje File Format]]).  The tool is released under the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html][GNU
General Public License 3]]. PajeNG comprises the ~libpaje~ library, and an
auxiliary tool called ~pj_dump~ to transform Paje trace files to
Comma-Separated Value (CSV). This dump tool also serves to validate
the contents of a Paje trace file. The space-time visualization tool
called pajeng had been deprecated (removed from the sources) since
modern tools do a better job (see ~pj_gantt~, for instance, or take a
more general approach using R+ggplot2 to visualize the output of
~pj_dump~). This effort was started as part of the french [[http://infra-songs.gforge.inria.fr/][INFRA-SONGS
ANR project]]. Development has continued through a collaboration between
[[http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/en/][INF/UFRGS]] (Brazil) and [[https://www.inria.fr/][Inria]] (France).
